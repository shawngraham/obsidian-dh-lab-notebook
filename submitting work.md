# Overview
+ sometimes, I'm looking for you to make a post in a relevant discord channel
+ other times, you'll need to be showing me a github repo filled with bits and bobs, plus a 'log' file that replicates what you'll find here in the [[worksheet]] template.
+ you _could_ keep everything in this vault, and then push the vault/folder to a single github repository. If you do that, then create a new repository, **don't initialize it with a readme**, the, on the command line in this vault/folder, follow broadly the instructions [here](https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/github-cli/).

## Where exactly do I submit work?[](https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/syllabus/faq/#where-do-i-submit-work)

-   Collaborative Reading: respond to the online annotations as per the instructions; add a check-mark reaction in the `#reading-prep` channel to the relevant post once you’ve done so. Respond to responses to your annotations online.
-   Digital Basics: do the appropriate tutorials; keep your materials in a github repository. Use the submission form to send me the repository links. **Nb you can also ask for general help from everyone in this channel**
